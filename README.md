Open the [Assignment 4 Jupyter Notebook](assignment4.ipynb) and follow the instructions.

Additionally, I have recorded a YouTube lecture available here https://youtu.be/7ZQZTufsZBQ to provide some supplementary context and tips.

## Testing

If you would like to check to see if your solution is correct, run the following commands at the Terminal command line in sequence:

```bash
python test.py
```

a status message of `OK` means you have the correct solution.
